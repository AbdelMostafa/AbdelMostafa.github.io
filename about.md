I am a first year PhD student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/person/abdelrahman-zayed/) supervised by [Sarath Chandar](http://sarathchandar.in/). Before joining Mila, I received my MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Concordia University, under the supervision of [Hassan Rivaz](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~hrivaz/). I hold a BSc in Electrical Engineering from Cairo University.
